# PatternStore MVP Roadmap

## üéØ Goal
Complete the Manage Patterns dialog to make it fully functional for creating, editing, and managing patterns.

---

## üìã Tasks

### 1. Add New Pattern Creation
- [x] Add `+` icon button to the right side of "Workspace" section header
- [x] Add `+` icon button to the right side of "User" section header
- [x] Always show sections even when they have 0 patterns
- [x] Implement create new pattern functionality:
  - [x] Create pattern with dummy/placeholder values
  - [x] Add new pattern at the top of the respective list
  - [x] Visual indicator that pattern is incomplete/invalid
  - [x] Auto-select newly created pattern in details view

### 2. Details View - Core Functionality
- [x] Clicking a pattern populates the details view with its data
- [x] Save button updates/overwrites the selected pattern
- [x] Delete button removes pattern everywhere

- [x] Empty state when no pattern is selected:

#### 2.1 Bug: 
- [x] details view - remove -> cancel should not make the details view empty

### 3. Details View - UI Improvements
- [ ] Replace flag text labels with VSCode icons - Duplicating vs code ui

- [x] Make UI more compact:
  - [x] Reduce padding/spacing
  - [x] Smaller input fields
  - [x] Condensed form layout
- [x] Add visual feedback for validation errors
- [x] Add auto fill into the details view - this way the user can make temporary changes that get injected into the search without having them permanent

#### 3.1 Bug:
- [x] detail view | an unseclected button needs two clicks to jump to selected but only one to jump to unselected. Also it does not alway seem to be in the correct state visually
- [x] regex validation does not show red indicator on initial load or when a new details is moved into the view
- [x] save is disabled if regex is invalid - this is unnecessary.  Just show the error but allow saving. -> never disable save
- [x] when selecting another element during saving of the current detail it jumps back to the saved on.

- [x] Load to Search returns "Pattern not found" error

- [x] The load to search button should not close the dialog
- [?] The load to search button in the details view should be some where else more prominent 
- [ ] we need to track if a detail is dirty and needs saving. (e.g. a cycle icon somewhere or be creative.)
- [ ] The load to search button should use the current details (which may be dirty) and send those instead of the item itself.

- [ ] Improve speed - use map for all lookups instead of array find



### 4. Resizable Panels
- [ ] Implement horizontal resize between pattern list and details view
- [ ] Add draggable divider/handle
- [ ] Save panel size preference in webview state

### 5. Remove redundant features
- [x] Remove Search view "Save" button.
- [ ] Remove Launch button. The manage is enough.

---
## 6. Fix 
- [ ] Storing id's in the config prevents user from manually editing the config file. We need to find a way to store the patterns without interfering with manual edits.


## Publish 
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Update documentation/screenshots
- [ ] Publish updated extension to VSCode Marketplace
---

## üöÄ Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+S` to save in details view)
- [ ] Duplicate pattern button
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder patterns
- [ ] Export/Import patterns
- [ ] Pattern validation with real-time feedback
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality
- [ ] The currently selected item should always stay on top independent of search and filtering

---


## üìù Notes
- Keep the search functionality working throughout all changes
- Maintain collapsible section state
- Ensure proper message passing between webview and extension
- Test with both empty and populated pattern lists
