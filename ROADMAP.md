# PatternStore Roadmap


## TODO before publish:
- [ ] if include and exclude are empty they should still overwrite old left over values in the search panel
- [ ] improve/update the readme file.


## Publish 
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Update documentation/screenshots
- [ ] Publish updated extension to VSCode Marketplace
---

## 6. Fix (postponed)
- [ ] Storing id's in the config prevents user from manually editing the config file. We need to find a way to store the patterns without interfering with manual edits. Postponed for now.
---


## ðŸš€ Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+S` to save in details view)
- [ ] Duplicate pattern button
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder patterns
- [ ] The currently selected item should always stay on top independent of search and filtering
